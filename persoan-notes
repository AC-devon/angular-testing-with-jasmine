SOMETIMES - IN OPRATE THIS TESTING ENV YOU NEED TO RELOAD THE PAGE

questions for TDD (test driven development)

does TDD is replacement for manual testing?
should i write TDD before code my app?
how to define what i need to test? (key factors to test)

pros and cons of creating TDD

pros:
1. create definition of result for each test
2. prevent worrying about breaking the app when new feature added
3. legacy code become less "scary" to handle
4. save time for manual testing
5. catch errors before release

cons:
1. write more code - production code + test code (time consuming)
2. added learning curve
3. refactor code may require rewrite test code
4. decide when you need to TDD or not


types of test
1. unit test - test a component without any extrnal resources (in angular world it means, test component without his template. and use instance like service and routher as fake once)
2. integration test - test a component with extrnal resources
3. e2e test - test our app as a whole


clean coding practice!
1. small functions (10 line max)
2. proper naming
3. single responsibility 


triple A rule
1. arange
2. act
3. assert


// x before describe or it are present a canceld test;

to check test coverage you need to run the following command in the cli:
ng test --code-coverage

how much to code coverage is best?
around 70% for budget project
other wise - complex logic testing only.
